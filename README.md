# mallet
A CNC-fabricated mallet for use during assembly of the Wren chassis

![alt tag](https://github.com/wikihouseproject/mallet/blob/master/mallet_v2.1.jpg)

The mallet or 'persuader' is perfectly weighted for Wren chassis assembly. Should be well-assembled using glue and screws, and the handle chamfered to avoid blisters. Note they will wear, so several will be required during a build. Position them onto cutting sheets in leftover areas.
